## üß™ SUMMARY 

In this lab, I manually remediated the DISA STIG vulnerability WN10-AU-000500, which requires the Application event log size to be configured to at least 32,768 KB. I began by scanning a Windows 10 virtual machine using Tenable with the Windows 10 STIG audit policy to identify vulnerabilities. From the scan results, I selected STIG ID WN10-AU-000500 to address. Upon inspection, I found that the required registry path (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\Application) did not exist, and the current event log size was set below the required threshold. To remediate the issue, I manually created the missing registry folders and set the MaxSize DWORD value to 32768. After applying the fix, I rescanned the system using Tenable, which confirmed that the vulnerability had been resolved. 

## üéØ Final Status:
‚úÖ **DISA-STIG WN10-AU-000500 successfully remediated manually and verified through Tenable.**
